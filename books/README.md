### Math 2001 (Sec 006) Conventions

Here is a list of some conventions used in this class that differ from the conventions used in our textbook.

1. During the first part of this class, while working with the "Book of Proof" (**BoP**), we will take **set theory** to be our foundation for mathematics; as such, every mathematical object is defined as a certain **set**.  In the second part of the course, when we begin the "Logic and Proof" (**LaP**) book, we will relax this restriction and work with other sorts of objects, such as **types** (these will be defined later).

2. We define the **natural numbers**, denoted by the symbols 0, 1, 2, …, to be the *sets* ∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}, {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}}, etc.  More simply, we define the following sets: 0 := ∅ (the *empty* set, which has no elements), 1 := {0} (the set containing the empty set), 2 := {0, 1}, …, n := {0, 1, …, n-1}.  (Contrast this with the convention used in **BoP** which takes the set of natural numbers to be the set of symbols {1, 2, 3, …}; in a number of places the author even explicitly states that the symbols 1, 2, 3,… do *not* represent sets.
