## Textbook Errata 

Here is a list of textbook errata and comments on conventions used by our textbook that we will not adhere to in this class.

The first half of this class is based on (naive) set theory, and we take every mathematical object to be a set.  

1. We define the natural numbers, denoted by the symbols 0, 1, 2, …, to be the sets ∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}, {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}}, etc.  More simply put, we define the natural numbers to be the following sets: 0 := ∅, 1 := {0}, 2 := {0, 1}, …, n := {0, 1, …, n-1}.  This contrasts with our books convention which takes the set of natural numbers to be the set of symbols {1, 2, 3, …}, and in a number of places the author explicitly states that such symbols do not represent sets.
