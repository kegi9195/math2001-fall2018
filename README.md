-----------------------------------
## Introduction
You are now reading the main course web page and syllabus for Math 2001.

*This page will be updated throughout the semester. Students are expected to visit this page periodically.* 

For this class the CU D2L system will be used only for recording grades. 

---
## Course Description 
Formal introduction to the concepts of logic, finite and infinite sets,
functions, methods of proof and axiomatic systems. Learning mathematical
expressions in writing is an integral part of the course. 

This course emphasizes the reading and writing of mathematical proofs.

---
## Learning Outcomes

Students will gain proficiency in reading and writing proofs, as well as solving
computational problems, concerning the following topics:

See the list of [Course Objectives](#course-objectives) below for more details.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
## Textbook Information
### Recommended Books
We will use the following textbooks in this class:

1. [Book of Proof](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/), Hammack.
2. [Logic and Proof](books/logic_and_proof.pdf), Avigad, Lewis, and van Doorn [(source)](https://github.com/leanprover/logic_and_proof).


Students are expected to have access to each of these books.
It may be possible for some students to get by with just the lecture
notes, but that is not recommended.  

### Alterntive References
Here are some other (optional) supplementary textbooks that students might find useful:

1. [How To Prove It](https://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-Structured-Approach-2nd/dp/0521675995/) by Daniel J. Velleman.

2. [Mathematical Reasoning: writing and proof](https://sites.google.com/site/mathematicalreasoning3ed/) by Ted Sundstrom.

3. [Mathematical Logic](https://books.google.com/books/about/Mathematical_Logic.html?id=4GzCAgAAQBAJ) by Stephen Cole Kleene.

The first two of these supplementary books are similar in coverage to "Book of Proof."
The third is a more advanced book on logic and foundations of mathematics.
It is included in the list because the other books might leave some students unsatisfied, since their primary purpose is to provide a gentle introduction to abstract mathematics, so they  carefully avoid overwhelming students with technical details.


---
## Writing Intensive Aspects
This class will use writing to promote the learning of course materials and written assignments 
will contribute significantly to the student's grade.  In particular, students will be actively engaged 
in the reading and writing of formal and informal proofs of mathematical statements.
 
The types of writing assigned will vary and may include formal and informal 
writing. More details about each writing assignment will be provided in that assignment's description.  

Another aspect of the writing component of this course that will be elucidated over the course of 
the semester is the problem of determining what constitutes a mathematical proof and at what level of detail and formality a proof should be presented.  Developing the skills required to determine the appropriate presentation style of mathematical arguments requires a lot of practice and experience; one objective of this course is to give the students an opportunity to gain such experience.

-----------------------------------
## Attendance
Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused).
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) **five**
absences in total, and you must
<a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=math-2001-absence">email the instructor</a>
if/when you miss a class. Each additional absence, and any absence not mentioned to the instructor,
may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.

Occasionally attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in
sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. If another student asks
you to sign in for them, don't do it. Forging another student's signature
constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to
the Office of Judicial Affairs.

**Important:** If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.

---
## Code of Conduct and Cheating
Students must abide by [the university's code of conduct](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior).
In particular, cheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy
will be referred to and dealt with by the UH Office of Judicial Affairs in a
manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to
expulsion from the university.

---
## Use of Electronics During Lecture
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.
Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for example, is totally
unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to focus on what is
being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting to other
students. 

**Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated to math will not be tolerated.**

**Laptops may be used in the classroom only for work related to this course.**

---
## Grading Policy
The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ Homework: 40 points total  
+ Two midterm exams: 30 points (15 each)  
+ Final exam: 30 points  

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted depending on overall student 
performance.

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    


-----------------------------------
## Exams
There will be two midterm exams each worth 15%, and a final exam worth 30% of the course grade.

+ **MIDTERM EXAM 1** covering chapters (tbd)  
**DATE:** tbd  
**TIME:** tbd  
**LOCATION:** CLUB 13
  
+ **MIDTERM EXAM 2** covering chapters (tbd)  
**DATE:** tbd  
**TIME:** tbd  
**LOCATION:** CLUB 13

+ **FINAL EXAM** (cumulative)  
**DATE:** Sunday, December 16, 2018   
**TIME:** 1:30--4pm   
**LOCATION:** CLUB 13

In accordance with university policy, **the final exam must be taken by all students at the scheduled time in the usual classroom.** *Do not make plans which would have you depart campus before the scheduled final exam date.*

-----------------------------------
## Homework
The homework will account for 40% of the course grade and will be
assigned every other week at the beginning of class.

Here are some important facts about the homework policy in this class.

+ **You must submit a hard copy of your homework**; electronic submissions, e.g. email attachments, are not acceptable.
+ **Homework submitted at the end of class on the due date will be penalized 10%.** 
+ **Homework submitted after then end of class on the due date will not be accepted or graded.**
+ **Homework is graded on correctness and overall presentation**, including clarity, legibility, and style.
 
The lowest (or missed) homework score
will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.

Descriptions of each homework assignment will be available in the 
homework directory of this repository. Homework is due in class
on Wednesday two weeks after it is assigned. 

You are strongly encouraged to start the homework early, so that you can finish on time, and so that there is time to speak to the instructor 
if you have questions.

-----------------------------------
## Make-up Policy
**No late homework will be accepted for any reason.**  If you fail
to submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt
your final course grade since the lowest homework score will be dropped.

Generally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, 
if you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,
and if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,
then you might be able to take a make-up exam *before the scheduled exam time*.

To request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of
one of the following:

+ Documented medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.
+ Documented medical excuse - a member of the student's family has a medical emergency.
+ Extra curricular activity sponsored University of Colorado.
+ Armed forces deployment (military duty).
+ Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.
+ A conflict with another exam or if you have three or more final exams on a
  given day.  (In each case the exam with the fewest students must arrange the make-up exam.)

If you miss an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).

-----------------------------------------------------------
## Asking Questions
Students are strongly encouraged to ask lots of questions.
If you don't understand something, please ask!

1. **In Lecture.** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **On Piazza.** Another good place to ask a question is the online discussion
   forum.
   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students
   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].

   This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
   classmates and the professor.  Rather than emailing questions to the
   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). 

   The Piazza page for this class is [https://piazza.com/colorado/fall2018/math2001/home](https://piazza.com/colorado/fall2018/math2001/home).

------------
## Email Policy
You may email the instructor directly, though the response
time might be a slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.

If you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 317:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">this
link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should
pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least
indicate which class you are in, your email might go unanswered.

---------------------------------------------
## Students With Disabilities
If you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the [Student Disability
Services Office](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/) for information 
on appropriate policies and procedures. 
The next step is to talk to the instructor who will be happy to assist with 
accommodations, but **will not provide them retroactively** 
(so file the appropriate requests and paperwork well before the first exam!).

Students must have their paper work in order and should contact the instructor 
early in the semester in order to have their learning needs appropriately met.
